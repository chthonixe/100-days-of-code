# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on freeCodeCamp.com's exercises to learn basic HTML and CSS. Read a a Tech Republic article on how to parse data from the web in python found here: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/parsing-data-from-the-web-in-python/. Read a chapter of Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and Javascript by Johnathan Stark. Watched three videos on how to code in bash. 

**Thoughts:** I'm very excited to have finally started this challenge! I had been coding off and on for several months but found I didn't have the knowledge base to create the kind of applications I wanted to build. I've decided to start this challenge learning the basics, moving onto more intermediate code and then applying what I've learned as I go towards the individual apps/programs I am working on. It is a bit of a challenge, but I am optimistic it will be well worth the adventure!
