### Day 5: July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I worked on The Mayan Abacus and tried troubleshooting why I wasn't seeing the layout appear correctly. Realized I needed to set up a basic working environment, so used Mozilla Firefox's tutorial to edit the Apache file installed on my Mac OSX. Also added color to my buttons pulling those found in my banner using the Digital Color Meter.

**Thoughts** It is really great to be applying what I've learned to this project. Previously, I had projects in mind but they were much too large in scope to accomplish being a newbie. I conceptualized this project to take advantage of my current  level knowledge and to incrementally incorporate techniques as I learned them. I still feel as though I have an incredible way to go, but realize I am only on day 5 of this challenge. Being frustrated when I 'didn't make quite as much progress as I would have hoped' I found is a common feeling among programmers, and I am grateful to be a part of a community that is so supportive. I've realized that we are truly social creatures, and that finding your people can benefit all!

### Day 4: July 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on Jquery exercises on freeCodeCamp. Learned how to add script to a page to interact with various attributes and CSS elements on a page, and begain learning how to interact with other parts of the DOM using this powerful scripting language. 

**Thoughts** I truly believe this method of learning is benefiting me. I had previously tried learning Javascript and JQuery in book format and while helpful, it didn't pull all the concepts together for me. Seeing the code actively responding to your modifications is not only encouraging, but being a visual learner I find it steadily building confidence in the fact that this is a career that with dedication and perseverance I can actually do.

### Day 3: July 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through much more of freeCodeCamp's exercises and finished the Bootstrap section! 

**Thoughts** Though Bootstrap is only one of many frameworks, I feel it pairs nicely with the text I am reading for Building Android apps with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It gives a much more elegant framework and has taught me it can be beneficial learning new techniques even if they weren't originally on my schedule. I hope this is just one of many that I have the opportunity to learn!

## Day 2: July 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made it to the Bootstrap portion of freeCodeCamp's exercises. Also, started working on my interactive Mayan Abacus app.

**Thoughts** Yay! It seems consistently working on these exercises is paying off. I had enough confidence with what I've learned to start working on an app of my own making. Though I need to rely heavily on reference material and am still struggling with a bit of the syntax I am happy to have started a unique project. During the building of this web app, I hope to improve my overall knowledge and understanding of Javascript and use it to create an interactive 'abacus' that supports Canvas functionality. ad Astra!

## Day 1: July 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more of freeCodeCamp's exercises to continue building my general knowledge oF HTML, CSS, and the 10 Common Data Structures in Javascript. 

**Thoughts** I am very happy to finally be studying code in a well organized format. Previously I had done a lot of reading, but using the website's interactive format is nice because it allows me to immediately see the effects of my code. I know I still have a lot to accomplish to build the kind of apps I want, but I believe I am well on my way!

### Day 0: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on freeCodeCamp.com's exercises to learn basic HTML and CSS. Read a a Tech Republic article on how to parse data from the web in python found here: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/parsing-data-from-the-web-in-python/. Read a chapter of Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and Javascript by Johnathan Stark. Watched three videos on how to code in bash. 

**Thoughts:** I'm very excited to have finally started this challenge! I had been coding off and on for several months but found I didn't have the knowledge base to create the kind of applications I wanted to build. I've decided to start this challenge learning the basics, moving onto more intermediate code and then applying what I've learned as I go towards the individual apps/programs I am working on. It is a bit of a challenge, but I am optimistic it will be well worth the adventure!
