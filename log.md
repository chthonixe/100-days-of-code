# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 2: 

**Today's Progress**: Made it to the Bootstrap portion of freeCodeCamp's exercises. Also, started working on my interactive Mayan Abacus app.

**Thoughts** Yay! It seems consistently working on these exercises is paying off. I had enough confidence with what I've learned to start working on an app of my own making. Though I need to rely heavily on reference material and am still struggling with a bit of the syntax I am happy to have started a unique project. During the building of this web app, I hope to improve my overall knowledge and understanding of Javascript and use it to create an interactive 'abacus' that supports Canvas functionality. ad Astra!

## Day 1: July 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more of freeCodeCamp's exercises to continue building my general knowledge oF HTML, CSS, and the 10 Common Data Structures in Javascript. 

**Thoughts** I am very happy to finally be studying code in a well organized format. Previously I had done a lot of reading, but using the website's interactive format is nice because it allows me to immediately see the effects of my code. I know I still have a lot to accomplish to build the kind of apps I want, but I believe I am well on my way!

### Day 0: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on freeCodeCamp.com's exercises to learn basic HTML and CSS. Read a a Tech Republic article on how to parse data from the web in python found here: http://www.techrepublic.com/article/parsing-data-from-the-web-in-python/. Read a chapter of Building Android Apps with HTML, CSS, and Javascript by Johnathan Stark. Watched three videos on how to code in bash. 

**Thoughts:** I'm very excited to have finally started this challenge! I had been coding off and on for several months but found I didn't have the knowledge base to create the kind of applications I wanted to build. I've decided to start this challenge learning the basics, moving onto more intermediate code and then applying what I've learned as I go towards the individual apps/programs I am working on. It is a bit of a challenge, but I am optimistic it will be well worth the adventure!
